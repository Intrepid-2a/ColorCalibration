# Colour Calibration

Calibrate colors to present stimuli to one eye only for participants wearing red-green glasses.

At the start, there should be six dots, three above fixation and three below.

Close one eye and keep looking at the fixation cross.

The middle dots should be flickering. Either the top-left and bottom-right or vice versa should be dark dots, with the other two being very light or invisible. Use the arrow keys to make the light dots invisible if they aren't already. Then keep the other eye closed and adjust the other color to make the other two dots invisible.

- Up-down: controls green
- Left-right: controls red

Press `space` to finish colour calibration and write the values to `..\data\color\XXX_col_cal_#.txt` where XXX is the participant ID, and # is the number of calibration attempts. The highest numbered calibration will be used by other tasks.
